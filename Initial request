What I understand  is that Jean wants us to look at the 2 main systematic reviews and find flaws. He precisely says that these reviews have been   based on some large series.  He also asks to review the weaknesses on these basic articles. Then he asks us to write brief report of the weaknesses. Write a presentation of 5 minutes.


 Method.  Find the systematic reviews and the referenced articles.  review critically. This may mean that we will have to recur to the Cochrane toolbox.Write a brief report of the weaknesses.  I should focus on the endovascular treatment of spinal AVMs.

 1) The first weakness  is that the systematic review is based on some large series.
 2) Which classifications  do people actually use.
 3) The way clinical results are reported,  is it satisfactory?  do we need to more standardized way?
 4) What improvements can be made? How can we improve knowledge gap?
